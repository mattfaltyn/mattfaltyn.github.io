Hello! My name is Matt and I enjoy solving problems at the intersection of the biomedical, computer, and mathematical sciences. My interest in biomedical research started back when I entered the [Arts & Science Undergraduate Program](https://artsci.mcmaster.ca/) at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/) in hopes of entering medical school post-graduation. After the first three semesters, I decided to pursue my growing interest in mathematics and combine my Arts & Science program with the Mathematics program (similar to a double-degree). I earned an Honours Bachelor of Arts & Science and Mathematics degree from McMaster University in 2021.

Fast-forward to today, and I am a Master of Science in Mathematics (Applied Mathematics) student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) under the supervision of [Dr. Elina Robeva](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~erobeva/index.html) in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.ubc.ca/home) and the [Institute for Applied Mathematics](https://www.iam.ubc.ca/). My current research focuses on biomedical applications of tensor decompositions and probabilistic graphical models. In addition to my work in the biomedical sciences, I am a student in the Graduate Pathway on Blockchain and Decentralized Trust Technologies Training Program in [Blockchain@UBC](https://blockchain.ubc.ca/) where I apply my knowledge of statistical methods to blockchain networks and cryptocurrency data.

Outside of my work in academia, I currently work in a [digital asset infrastructure provider](https://www.aquanow.io/) as a Blockchain Researcher. I have previously worked in a [Bitcoin mining company](https://www.blockwaresolutions.com/), a [federal government agency](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/start), as well as founded my own [organization](https://llettonna.com/). 

One of my professional goals is to conduct meaningful research while completing a Ph.D. in bioinformatics or a closely related field. Having conducted interdisciplinary work with collaborators of diverse backgrounds, I find that most difficult problems with potential for positive impact capture my interest given enough time and training.
