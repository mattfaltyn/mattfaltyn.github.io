I’m an Applied Mathematics Master’s student at the University of British Columbia interested in applying machine learning and statistical methods to biomedical data. I earned an Honours Bachelor of Arts & Science and Mathematics degree from McMaster University in 2021.

## Interests

Outside of my work in the quantitative life sciences, I conduct research in Bitcoin, blockchain technologies, and cryptography. I enjoy long distance running (13-26 miles), hiking, and lounging on the beach.

## Goals
One of my professional goals is to conduct meaningful research while completing a PhD in bioinformatics or a closely related field. Having conducted interdisciplinary work with collaborators of diverse backgrounds, I find that most difficult problems with potential for positive impact capture my interest given enough time and training.
