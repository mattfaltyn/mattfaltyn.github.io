Hello! My name is Matt and I enjoy solving problems at the intersection of the biomedical, computer, and mathematical sciences. My interest in biomedical research started back when I entered the [Arts & Science Undergraduate Program](https://artsci.mcmaster.ca/) at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/) in hopes of entering medical school post-graduation. After the first three semesters, I decided to pursue my growing interest in mathematics and combine my Arts & Science program with the Mathematics program (similar to a double-degree). I earned an Honours Bachelor of Arts & Science and Mathematics degree from McMaster University in 2021.

Fast-forward to today, and I am a Master of Science in Mathematics (Applied Mathematics) student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) under the supervision of [Dr. Elina Robeva](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~erobeva/index.html) in the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.ubc.ca/home) and the [Institute for Applied Mathematics](https://www.iam.ubc.ca/). 

## Interests

Outside of my work in the quantitative life sciences, I conduct research in Bitcoin, blockchain technologies, and cryptography. I enjoy long-distance running (13-26 miles), hiking, and lounging on the beach.

## Goals
One of my professional goals is to conduct meaningful research while completing a Ph.D. in bioinformatics or a closely related field. Having conducted interdisciplinary work with collaborators of diverse backgrounds, I find that most difficult problems with potential for positive impact capture my interest given enough time and training.
