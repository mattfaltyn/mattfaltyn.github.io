Hello! My name is Matt and I enjoy solving problems at the intersection of the biomedical, computer, and mathematical sciences. My interest in biomedical research started back when I entered the [Arts & Science Undergraduate Program](https://artsci.mcmaster.ca/) at [McMaster University](https://www.mcmaster.ca/) in hopes of entering medical school post-graduation. After the first three semesters, I decided to pursue my growing interest in mathematics and combine in the Mathematics Program (similar to a double-degree). I earned an Honours Bachelor of Arts & Science and Mathematics degree from McMaster University in 2021.

I’m an Applied Mathematics Master’s student at the University of British Columbia interested in applying machine learning and statistical methods to biomedical data. 

## Interests

Outside of my work in the quantitative life sciences, I conduct research in Bitcoin, blockchain technologies, and cryptography. I enjoy long distance running (13-26 miles), hiking, and lounging on the beach.

## Goals
One of my professional goals is to conduct meaningful research while completing a PhD in bioinformatics or a closely related field. Having conducted interdisciplinary work with collaborators of diverse backgrounds, I find that most difficult problems with potential for positive impact capture my interest given enough time and training.
