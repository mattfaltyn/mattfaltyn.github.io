## My Three Obsessions: Measurement, Compression, and Paradoxical Tension

### Measurement
Measurement is the process of assigning a numerical value(s) to a particular attribute(s) or property(ies). Measurement is deceivingly complicated for several reasons, including validity, reliability, subjectivity, and complexity concerns. For example, how do we measure the strength of a friendship? 

### Compression
Compression refers to reducing data size to optimize storage or enhance transmission speeds while retaining as much of the original information as possible. This concept is notably intricate due to considerations like lossless versus lossy methods, efficiency, data integrity, and algorithmic diversity. For instance, how do we compress a high-resolution image without noticeably degrading its quality?

### Paradoxical Tension
Paradoxical tension refers to the coexistence of seemingly contradictory or opposing forces that create a state of conflict or tension, challenging conventional understanding and requiring the navigation of paradoxical elements. For example, the tension between ego and humility; one cannot operate in the world without successfully managing this tension.
