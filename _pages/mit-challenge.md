# MIT Challenge

Inspired by [Scott H. Young's MIT Challenge](https://www.scotthyoung.com/blog/myprojects/mit-challenge-2/), I am going to complete 12 MIT computer science courses in under 12 months through [MIT OpenCourseWare](https://ocw.mit.edu/).

During my formal training in mathematics, I spent some time writing and analyzing software. Getting a taste of computer science through programming only increased my interest in understanding how computers work.
