The nature and magnitude of the cognitive and mental health risks among the offspring of young mothers is not fully understood. 
Our objective is to examine the risk of mental disorders in these offspring. Young mothers’ offspring have more cognitive, 
externalizing, and internalizing problems across the lifespan than individuals born to mothers ≥21 years of age. 
They may benefit from early detection and support.
